# Open Waters

Open Waters is a place where fly fishers, guides, and fly fishing shops can share fishing and river reports and keep track of their own fishing statistics. The goal for Open Waters is to create a web application where users can create an account and post their river reports and get information from other users on the best place to fish.

Most fly fishing shops will regularly post river reports from their most recent guide trip, however, these reports are generally very wordy and take a big effort to create for the guides. Customers use these reports to find out where to find and what equipment to bring. This is a valuable form of advertising for a fly shop as the reports will list the flies they used so customers can go to the store to purchase a similar set of flies for their next outing. Fly shops generate about 11% of their annual revenue from fly purchases. It is very valuable for a fly shop to bring a customer in even for a simple fly purchase as it often results in a larger purchase of other equipment than just flies.

With Open Waters, it becomes very easy to create quick fishing reports and even include exact GPS location from Google Maps. It also gives power to the hobbyist fly fishers who want to contribute to the online community to help others find the best places and the best way to fish. Since Open Waters is an open community for all fly fishers, a fishing report posted on Open Waters will give the fly shop a way to reach new customers in a direct way.
